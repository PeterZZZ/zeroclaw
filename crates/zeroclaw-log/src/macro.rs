//! The `record!` macro — a thin syntactic wrapper around `tracing::event!`
//! that gives every emission site a uniform kwarg API.
//!
//! Architecture: `record!` has NO write path of its own. It expands to a
//! single `tracing::event!` call. The `LogCaptureLayer` (installed once
//! in the daemon's tracing-subscriber chain) is the SOLE consumer that
//! turns tracing events into [`crate::LogEvent`]s and writes them to:
//!
//!   1. JSONL persistence (when enabled via `[observability] log_persistence`)
//!   2. The process-wide broadcast Sender (dashboard SSE)
//!   3. The Observer bridge (Prometheus / OTel typed metrics)
//!
//! Field schema lives in exactly one place: `FieldCollector` in
//! [`crate::layer`]. The macro doesn't enforce a whitelist; unknown
//! fields land in the event's `attributes` map. Adding a new typed
//! field means: add to `LogEvent` struct + add a `FieldCollector` arm.
//! The macro stays untouched.
//!
//! Usage:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use zeroclaw_log::record;
//!
//! record!(
//!     INFO,
//!     action: "llm_request",
//!     category: "agent",
//!     outcome: "success",
//!     agent: agent_alias,
//!     channel: "discord.clamps",
//!     model_provider: "anthropic.clamps",
//!     model: "claude-sonnet-4-6",
//!     trace_id: turn_id,
//!     duration_ms: 412_u64,
//!     message: "LLM request completed",
//! );
//! ```
